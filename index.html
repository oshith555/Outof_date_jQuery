          <h3>Astera Base</h3>
          <p>
            Astera is built primarily out of wood, some taken from the very ships that brought the Research Commission to the New World. It sits below a waterfall between the Ancient Forest and Wildspire Waste. Astera is more of a base than a village, built to support the Hunters and researchers as they explore the New World and its ecology. It is built in three primary tiers, with winding stairs and a waterwheel-powered series of chain pulleys to move people and supplies quickly.

          <h3>Special Arena</h3>
          <p>
            The Special Arena is located within the Great Ravine and features several contraptions that can aid Hunters in battle, including ballistae, cannons, a Dragonator, and a pile of boulders that can be dropped on a monster. Access is via a zipline and a crawl through the rock face, likely to prevent monsters from escaping.

          <h3>Ancient Forest</h3>
          <p>
            The Ancient Forest is a thick, lush area home to a variety of flora, fauna, and monsters. It can't easily be traversed by normal means and is one of the most iconic locations introduced in Monster Hunter: World.

          <p>
            The Coral Highlands is a vast landscape resembling the ocean floor, filled with many species of coral. Comprised of steep cliffs that form a highland, hunters will traverse the colorful upper areas and ominous lower levels to achieve their objectives.
